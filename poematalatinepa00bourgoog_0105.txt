With a courage undaunted‚ may 1 face my last day,
And when 1 am dead may the better sort say,
In the morning when soher, in the evening when
mellow,
He’s gone, and not left behind him his fellow.
May Igovern‚ etc.

Without any noise ¹¹ when I've pass'd o’er the stage,

And decently acted what part fortune¹ gave,

And put off my vest ¹¹¹ in a cheerful¹¹ old age,

May a few honest fellows see me laid iu my grave.
May I govern, etc.

Ι aare not, whether under a turf or a stone,

With any inscription upon it, or noue:

Ila thousand years hence, Here lies W, ΡΟ.

Shall be read on my tomb, what is it to me?
May 1 govern, etc.

Yet oue wish I add, for the sake of those fene ⁵
Who in reading these lines any pleasure shall tahe3

¹ That 1 may die regularly, obserying all the ceremonies, lor-
malities, and punctualities: ‘ h la coutume‚' which is, according
to our barbarous translation, ‘ to a cow's thumb.'

¹¹ Secretnm iter, et fallentis semita vitae. Hon.

Nec vixit male, qui natus moriensque fefellit. Innn.

¹ —Quem dederat cursum fortuna, peregi. Vrsa.
· ¹1¹ My garments of flesh, wherein Ι acted my part on the stage
ol the-world: when the incentore, and the curtain dmwn.
