may be new to some who shall read this, I will set it down in few
words. A Dutch traveller, with his servant, lighted ct the iun
which lies out of the town, aud thence sent bis servant into it to
find out the best wine, orderiug him to write nor upon the door
osthe house whereiu he found good wine ς where he found better,
nsr, nsr3 where the best, nsr, nor, ssr ; the servant obeyed his
commands punctually. The muster followslcnd finds the tavern
bearing this last inscription ; aud drank so much, that it cast him
iuto a sever, whereoi he died. His servant buried him in the
choreb, engraving upon his tomb-stoue this epitaph, which is
still to be seen there :
scr, nsr, cor.
inorruit uturum mr.
ro. on ruo. o. nuos moncons rsr.

⁸ Hinc ad vina redit laetus, et alteris
Te mensis adhibet deum.

Diffuso pateris, et laribus tuum

Et magni memor Herculis.
longas, o utinam, dur boue, terias
Praestes hesperiae, dicimus integro
Sicci manc die, dicimus uvidi,
Cum sol oceono subest.
