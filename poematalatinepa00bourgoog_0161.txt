Let other monarche, with invasive hands,
Lessen their people, and extend their lands ‚·

By gasping nations hated and obey’d‘,

Lords of the desem, that their sword has made3
For thee kind heav’n a nobler task design’d, “

Το fix thy empire 011 thy people's mind ;

High 011 thy British throne, to mark from far,
And calm the billows of the rising war3

To smooth the frowns on fair Europa’s faoe,

And force reluctant nations to embrace.

As late the jarring winde, with mingled tour,
Struggled to wreck, yet wafted you to shore:

So shall the storm, that threats your peaoeful land,
130ss harmless 0'er‚ or burst, where you command.
