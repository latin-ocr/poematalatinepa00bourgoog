Another new
Shall then ensue,
Another nonu—to pass.

But, all the while,

And tempt the lover’s core: ‘

Assigns not fate,

As plain, too plain, appears;

Days four or five,

But hers as many yours.

Yet, gentlestrace,
Your fleeting grace
To blooming Phyllis lend:

And, as you fade,
Remind the maid,
