Let faithful Abrom’s rece their off 'rings bring,

By tuneful David taught ,his proise to sing,

'Ilieir guide, their legislator, and their king:
Whospread o'er Egypt's lund¹ substantiol night,
Who with a longer sun did J oshua’s saith requite.

Ye priests of God, let praise like incense rise,

Though Coroh’s sons your order may de'spise,

And wish thepriest himselfo sacrifice. .
Praise him forothers too, land thus oommend
Your greatest en‘mies toyour only friend.

Praise him, his servants, who have learnt to see
There's nought so sweet 'as this eaptivity, ⁴
Fromwhence ’tis greatest bondage to be free. [move
’ Praise him, whose power can grontwhate’er you
Whoseeors will hear your prayers, for he is love.

Ye righteous mulsunteinted with your clay,
Spring through the vost expense, and wing 'your way,
To resch the ¹confines of eternal day,

Celestial enthems sing with seraphs joiu'd,
And, souls unbodied, bless th’ almighty mind. ’

ᾖ Ye humble men, whom sels-admiring pride,
With all its baits oould never drew aside,

, Praise him, whose love does o’er the meek preside;

Who throws the purple tyrants from their seat,

Audmokes the poor of spirit rich and great.
