THE sNowbRop.

Wrru head reclin'd, the snowdrop see!
, The first of Flora’s progeny,

In virgin modesty appear,

To hail and weloome in the year!

Fearless of winter, it defles

The rigour of inclement skies,
And early hastens forth to bring
The tidings of approaching spring.

Α Though simple in its dress and plain,
It ushers in a beauteous train3
And claims, how gaudy e’er they be,
The merit of precedency.

All that the gay or sweet compose,
The pink, the violet, and the rose,
In fair succession as they blow,

Tbeir glories to the snowdrop owe.
