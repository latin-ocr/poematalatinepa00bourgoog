When nature fails, ¹ond day and night -
Divide thy works no more3

My ever-grateful heort, 0 Lord,
Thy mercy shall adore.

Through all eternity to thee
’ Α joyful song l’ll raise!

But O! eternity’s too short
. To utter all thy praise.

HYMN THE SECOND.

How ore thy servants blest, O Lord!

How sure is their defenoe!
Eternal wisdom is their guido,
Their help omnipotente.

In foreign realms and lands remote,
Supported by thy oare;

Through burning elimes l pass’d unhurt,
And hreeth’d in tainted air.

Thy mercy sweeten'd every soil,
Made every region please‚

The hoory Alpine hills it warm’d
And smooth’d the Tyrrhene seae- ·
