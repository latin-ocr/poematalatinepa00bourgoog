Whose vdsdhm, teaching well to hear,
Ssoths the bitterness of cnre3
Whose joy, if prosp'rous fate you meet,
Adds new sweetness to the sweet.
These ties will nuptisl love engage,
Down from youth to hoary age,
If e'er Melissa, lovely sponse,
Life’s compenion, crown your vows.

Such, such s conseri ehoose to wed,
⁴ Worthy of your board and bed.

And Roman wenlth in English sterling view.
Resd here, how Britain, once despis'd, can rsise
As ample sums, as Reme in Caesar's days5
