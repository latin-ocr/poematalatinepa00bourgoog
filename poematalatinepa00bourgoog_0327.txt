Ι THE JAcKDAw. ¹ ,

'lanan is a bird, who hy hia cont,
And hp the hoarscncss of his note,

mig tbe supposed a crow;
A great frequenter ol tho chorch,
Where bishop-lilm ha finds a perch,

And dormitory too.

Abova the staeple chines a plato,
That turns and turns, to iudicate
From what point blows the westher,
look up-—your braina begin to swim,
”fis in the clouds-that pleasas him,
He chcoses it the rather.

Fond ol the speculative height,
Thither ho wtngs his airy flight,
And thence securely sees
Tho bustle aud the rauca-show,
That occupy mankind below,
Securo sud at his ease.

You think, no doubt, he sits aud musas
On future broken bones and brumas,
lt he should chance to sall.
No; not a sin lo thought like that
Em loys his philosophie pate,
rtroubles it at all.

Ha scas, that this at round-about,
· Tho world, with al its motley rout,
Church, army, physic, law,
Its customs, aud its businesses
Is no concern at all ol his,
And says-what says hc l-Caw.

Thrice happy bird! I too⁶have seen
Much of the vanities of man3
And, sict ol having seen ’eun
Would cheorlully these limbo resign
For such a pair ol wings as chine,
And such a head between ’em
