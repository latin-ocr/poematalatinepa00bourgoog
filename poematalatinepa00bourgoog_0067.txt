Bravely secure in innocence,
And boldly resolute to die ;

Daring (so firmly ye withstood)
In spite of malice to be good.

Goon, ye hosts and armias bright,
Your voices, all ye saintS, to raise3
Goon, ye glorious sons of light,
‚ Your God and mighty King to praise:
While yearly we do here below
Acknowledge, what to you we owe. .
