· some or rme rrmmr cnrmmrrw. ll

Ye honey·dew's of Moy, like vapours rise,

Exhal'd in praises to your nativelskies ;

And hoary frost, which 0'er the meadow lies
Like ashes scotter'd by his bounteous hand,
Restoring vigour to the weoried land.¹

Praise him, ye frosm, that bind the earth in chains,
Praise him, ye oold, that human force rosnaium
Dead'ning the sense, and thrilling in the veins.
His praise for ever be by you extoll'd,
Inflam'd with ardours by th' extreme of oold.

Praise him, you host, long as the frozen' sea
In midst of storms enjoys a calm by thee:
And spotless snow,1the type of purity:

In εΗ your figur’d shopes his glory show,

'Forget not heaven obove,when fall’nonearth belowss

Be this your businem, ye laborious days,

And silent nights silver'd with glimmering rays ;

Exempt from' every work, but that of prame:
Whose piereing¹ eye does equol power 'display
In derkest midnight, ‘and in brightest da'y.

Praise him, Ο light, in heavenly beams arroy‘d;

Parent of day, and first of beings‚ shade;

Praise him, who reigr'r'd before the 'world was made 3
Who dwells in brightnem, ond who rides in night,
Majestio darkness, and alluring light.
