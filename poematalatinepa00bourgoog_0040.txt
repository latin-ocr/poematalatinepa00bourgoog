Praise him, ye heavens, long ae your frame shall lest,
Who like acurtoin spread the azure waste,
And in your happy reulms his throne hus ploo'd:
His utmost splendour still to you appears,-
Ο tune iu proise the musio of your spheres. ·

Waters, that, hythe Almighty plao’d above,

Fixt as your firiuument ior ever prove:

Praise him whose spirit did on the wetere move;
Who made you free from wiuds and storms below ‚·
Whose praise ean never ebh, nor ever flow.

Thronos, potentates, dominions, powers on high,
Acknowledge your superior in the sky;
And bless the universal Majesty 3
Whose word’s omnipotent‚ whose will is fote,
'l'he only powerful‚ aud the only great. Δ
