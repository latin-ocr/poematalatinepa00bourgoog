LOVE DISARM'D,

ΒΥ PRIOR·

Bnrvnsnn a myrtle's verdant shade,

As Chloe half asleep was laid,

Cupid perch'd lightly 011 her bremt,
And in that heaven desir'd to rest:
Over her paps his wings he spread,

Between he found a downy bed,
And neatled in his little head.

Still lay the god: the nymph surpris'd,
Yet mistress of herself, devis'd
How she the vagrant might inthra13
And captive him, who captives all.
Her boddiee half-way she unlae'd:
About his arms she slily cast
The silhen bend, and held him fast. ⁸

The god awak'd3 and thrice in vain
He strove to break the eruel chain:
And thrice in vain he shook his wing,
Eneumber'd in the silken string.

Flutt’ring the god, and weeping, said, '
“ Pity poor Cupid, genereus maid,
