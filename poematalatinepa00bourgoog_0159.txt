Pour forth as numerous legions on the plain,
And with more dreadful navies awe the main.
Though shorter lines her fix’d dominions bind,'
Her floating empire stretches unconfin'd.

From Thetis' stores, and not her neighbours' spoils
She drsws her measure, fruit of honest toils. ἡ
Rome sack’d‚ and plunder'd 3 Britain 'clothesand

‘Aequires their riches, but supplies their needs.

Sweet seat of freedom! be thy happier doom,
Το ’scape the fate, as well as guilt of Rome:
Where ri0t‚ offspring of unwieldy store,

Enerv'd those arms, that snatch’d the spoil before3
With costly cates she stain'd her frugal board,
Then with ill-gotten gold she bought a lord.

¹ corruption, discord, luxury combin'd‚

Down sunk the far-fam’d mistress of mankind.

Hear, righteous prinae! 0 hear us loud invoke
Thy worth unblemish'd, to avert this stroke:
Yourself so free from ev'ry 'lawless view,

You scarce admit the homage that is due.
