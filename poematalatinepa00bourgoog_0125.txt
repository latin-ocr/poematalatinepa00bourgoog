ou osny, woh-son by‘hisside, ¹ · ·

You've often regarded withwonder 3
He's dropsicnl, s'he is sore-ey'd,

Yet they're ever nneasy'nsunder. ’
Together they totter about,

Or sit in the sun at the door3
And ot night, when old Darby’s pot’s out,

His J oan will not smoke s whiff more.

No beauty nor wit they possess
Their several fhilings ·’ to smother3
Then what are-the cha'rms‚ can you guess‚
¹ Thnt make them so fond of each other?
'Tis the pleasing rememhrance of youth, ⁴
The endearments which youth did bestow;
The thoughts of past· pleasure and truth,

The hest of* ou'r blessings below.

These traces for ever will last3
No siokn'ess ortime can remove;
For when youth and heauty are past,
And age brings the winter of love,
A friendship insensihly grows
By reviews of such· raptures as these;
The current of fondness still shows,
Which decrepit old h'ge cannot freeze. .
