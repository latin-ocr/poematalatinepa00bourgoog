THE SONG OF

THE THREE CHILDREN.

Wyruru'urr God's‘fiat' did from nothing raise,
Stupendous produot of the first six days, Α
0 bless' your Maker, your3Creator praise.

In this let jarring elemento agree,
’ Or make from discord sweetest harmony.

Ye sons of light mado by his power divine3

By his reflected beams it is you shine3

Your hallelujahs in the chorus joir, '
That, far as creaturos can, your praise may prove
Great as his power, and endless as his love.
