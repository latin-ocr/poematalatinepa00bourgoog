Hm ye, whose sacred multitudea
In numbers cannot be expreat ;
Hail ye, that fill with winged orowda
The joyfnl regions of the blest ;
To you our humble verse we bring;
’Tio you instruet ua how to sing.

Ye bleat attendants of your Lord,

While he vooohsaf'd on earth to preaoh,
By bim as messengers the word

Throughout the world sent forth to teaoh ;
'Twas you the happy tidings brought,
Youraelveo performing what you taught.

Ye propheto, who with ardent real
And knowledge heavenly poasest,
To future agea did reveal
ΤΙιθ secrete of J ehovah’s hreast3
'Twas you, enlighten'd from above,
Foresaw and told that God was love.

Yon were the church'a best defenee,
Ye martyra now enthron'd on high,
