Come, let us go forth to the mead,

Let us see how the primrosee spring;
We’ll lodge in some village on Tweed,

And love, where the feathered folks sing.

How does my love pass the long day?
Does Mary not tend a few sheep?

Do they never carelessly stray,
While happily she lies asleep?

Tweed's murmure should lull her to rest,
Kind nature indulging my bliss ;

Το relieve the soft paine of my breast,
I'd steal an ambrosial kiss.

'Tis she does the virgins excel,
No heauty with her can eompare3

Love's greces ahl round her do dwell;
She's fairest, where thousands are fair.

Say, charmer, where do thy flocks stray?
Oh! tell me, at 11'0011 where they seed?

Shall 1 seek them on sweet-winding Tay,
Or the pleasanter hanks of the Tweed?
