ΟΝ ΑΝ ΟΡΕΝ GRAVE.

Lonomoos passenger, look down,
And see thy journey's end 3 =

See whither all thy weory steps,
'Tis hither, lo! they tend.

Observe the distance, mark how small!
But six feet deep or loss!¹

A measure scarce beyond thy own,
That leads from pain no ease.

Nor here alone, but wheresoe'en

Thy wenry footstepn oound,
Thy length and breadth will show the spot, ’
Where rest is no be found.

'I'hen patient the fatiguos of life,
With this reflection benr3

Thot journey eon't be ondlong,
Whooe end is ev’ry where.
