My life, ifthou preserv'st my life,
Thy sacrifice shall be3

And death, if death must be my doom,
Shall jain my soul to thee.

HYMN THE THIRD.

Wnan rising from the bed of death,
O'erwhelm’d with guila and fear,
1 see my Maker faae to face,

O! how shall 1 appear!

If yet, while pardon may be found, ⁵

And mercy may be saught,
My heart with inward horror shrinks,
And trembles at the thought.

When thou, Ο hard, shalt stand disclas'd
In majesty severe!

And sit in judgment 011 my saul,
01 how shall I appear! π

But thou hast told the troubled soul,
Who does her sins lament,

The timely tribute of her tears
Shall endless woe prevent.
