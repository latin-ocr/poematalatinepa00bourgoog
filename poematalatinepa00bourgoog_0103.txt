But if friends prove unfaithful, and fortune owhore ⁸¹,

Still may Ibe vinnons, though Ι am poor ,·

My life then as useless, may I freely resign,

When no longer Ι relish true wit and good uine.
May Ι govern, etc.

To outlire my senses⁸ may it nothe my fate,

To be blind, to be deaf, to know nothing at all ;

But rather let death come before ’tis so late,

And while there's some sapfin it, may my tree⁸ fall.
May Ι govern, etc.

Ihope Ι shall have no occasion to send
For priests or physicians, till I'm so near mine end,
That Ihave catull my hread, and dranlr my last glansh ‚·

Let them come then, and set their seals to my pass'1.
May Ι govern, etc.

‘¹ Fortuna, saevo laeta negotio, et
Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax,
Transmutat incertos honores,
Nunc mihi, nunc alii, benigna.
Laudo manentem. Si celeres quatit
Pennas, resigno quae dedit, et mea
Virtute me involvo——
—Hino apicem rapax
Fortuna cum stridore acuto
ὗ Sustinet; hic posuisse gaudet. Hor.
θ MayI not lose my sight, my hearing, and my memory, and
be aburthen to my friends, aud mysels : ‘Telluris inutile pondus,’

· adead, unuseiul burthen to the ground„ 1
