The boatswain gave the dreadfhl word,
The saile their swelling bosom spreed;
No longer must she stay aboasd:
They kiss’d3 she sigh'd ‚- he hung his head.
Her less'ning boat unwilling rows to land:
“ Adieu !’' she cries3 and wav’d her lily hand.

WnA'T beauties does Flora diselose!
How sweet are her smiles upon Tweed!
Yet Mary's, still sweeter than those,
Both nature and fancy exceed.
Nor daisy, nor sweet-blushing rose,
Nor all the gay flowers of the field,
Nor Tweed, gliding gently through those,
Such beauty and pleasure does yield.

The warblers are heard in the grove, ,
, The linnet, the harh, and the thrush3
The blachbird‚ and sweet-cooing dove,

With music enchant every bush.
