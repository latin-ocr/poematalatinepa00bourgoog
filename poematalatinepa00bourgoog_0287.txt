My old wife's trinkets still hang jingling down,

The same the nodding of my stoeplo crown.

My pulso beato olow and dull, my teeth are gone,

Not one oolt'o tooth is left, not half o one.

Whose stealing years bave spoil'd my somer proneÎ‡
Your powerful smiles can glodoome youth ronow
If you apploud her, nurse is old no more.
