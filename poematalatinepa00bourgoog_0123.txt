But, swoiu forsvroru, whoe'er thou ort,
Th'u hellow'd spot forbeor;
Remember Colin's dreodful fate,
And sear to meet him there.

Auvlcu ΤΟ CHLOE.

Α Duru Chloe, while thus beyond measure,
You trost me with doubts eud disdoiu,
You roh ull your youth of its plessure,

And hoard up sn old ege of pain.

, Your maxim, thot love is still founded

On ohrrms that will quiokly decoy,
You'll find to be very ill-grouuded‚
When once you itsdictotes obey.

ΤΙιε love, that from besuty is drawn,
By kindrress you ought to improve3
Soft looks eud goy smiles ere the down,
Fruition's the sunshine of love:
And though the bright heams of your eyes
Should be olouded, that now are so gay,
And darkness possess oll the shies,

We ue'er cau forget it was day.
