wmmax amn manualium. 51

Awake, she oded, thy true love calls,
Come from her midnight grave;
Now let thy pity hear the maid,
Thy love refus'd to eave.

This is the dask and fearful bour,
When injur’d ghosta eomplain3

Now dreary graves give up their dead,
To haunt the faithless swain.

Bethiuk thee, william, of thy fault,
Thy pledge, and broken ooth5
And give me back my maiden vow,

And give me back my troth.

How could you say my face was fair,
And yet that faoe forsake?

How could you win my virgin beart,
Yet leave that beart to break?

How could you promise love to me,
And not that promise keep ?

Why did you swear mine eyes-were might,
Yet leave those eyes to weep?

How oould you say my lip was aveat,
And made the scarlet pale?

And why did 1, young witless maid,
Believe the flattering tale?
