ODE.

Soon as the evening sbades prevail,

The moon takes up the wond’rous tole,
And nightly, to the listening earth,
Repeets the story of her birth:

Whilst all the staro, that round her burn,
And all the planete, iu their turn,
Gonfirm the tidings, es they roll,

And spread the truth from pole to pole.

What though, in solemn silence, all
Move round this durh, terrestriel hall?
What though nor real voioe uor sound
Amidst their radiant orbs be found?

In reesou'o ear they all rejoice,

Aud utter forth a glorious voice,

For ever singing as they ubine,

“Tun noun unhu· uunu ue 1su1v1u1t.''
