She spoke,'she died 3-her 'dorse was·borne;' ·
The bridegroom blithe¹ to meet3

He* in his wedding t'rim so g'ay,
She in her windingsheet.

Then what were perjnr'd Colin’s thoughts? ·
, ⁴How were· those nuptials kept?
The bridemen floclr’d round Lucy dead,
And all the village wept.
Compassion, shame, remorae, despair,

At once his bosom ariell,

The· damps of death bedew'd his brows, ·
He shoolr, he grean'd, he fell.

From the vain bride, (ab 1 bride no more 1)
The varying crimsen fied ;

When, stretch'd before her rival's-eorse,
She saw her husband dead.

He to his Lucy’s new-made grave,
Convey‘d by trembling swains,

One mould with her, beneath one-sod,
For ever now remains.

Ost atthis greve, the cdnstanthind
And plighted maid are seen,

With garlanda gay, and truelove knots
They deelr the sacred green.
