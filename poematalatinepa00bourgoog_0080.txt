ooniu’s cournmnr. 45

To think thot a heauty so gay,
So kind¹ and so onustant would prove3
Or go clud like our maidens in grey, ’
Or live in a oottnge on love!

What though I hove skill to complain!

Though the munes my temples have orown'd!
What though, when they hear my ooft ntroin,
The virgins sit weeping oround!
Ah, Colin! thy hopes are iu vain, ’
Thy pipe ond thy lourel resign3
Thy false one inclines to o swain,
Whose music is sweeter, than thino.

And you, my oompanions oo deor,
Who sorrow to see me betray'd,
Whntever I suffer, forbear,
Forheor to accuse the false maid.
Though through the wide world 1 should range,
’Tis in vain from my fortune to fly:
'Twas her's to be false and to change3
'Tis mine to be constant ond die.

lf, while my hard fate I sustam,

In her breast any pity is found,
Let her come with the nymphs of the plain,
. And see me laid low in the ground.
