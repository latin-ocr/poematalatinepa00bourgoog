THE FLY.

Busa, carious, thirsty fly,
Drink with me, and drink as 1;
Freely welcame to my cup,
Couldst thou sip, and sip it up;
Make the most of life you may,
Life ie short, and wears away.

Both alike, both thiae and mine,

’ Hasten quick to their deeline3
Thine's a summer, mine's 110 more,
Theugh repeated to threescore:
Threeseore summere, when they're gone,

Ι Wifl appear as short as one.

THE INVITATION
,To A ROBIN-RED-BREAST.

Domas'no bird, whom wintry blasae
Το eeek for human aid compel,

To me for warmth and shelter fly,
Weleome beneath my roof to dwell:
