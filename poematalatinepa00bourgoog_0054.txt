nunu run rrnsr. 19

When in the slippery patho of youth

⁴ ,With heedless steps 1 ron,

Thine arm unseen oonvey'd me nofe,
And led me up to man.

Through hidden daugma, toils and deaths,
It gently clear’d my way3

And through the pleosing suares of vice,
More to he fear'd than they.

When worn with sickness, oft host thou
With health renew’d my face;

And when in sins and sorrows suth,
Reviv'd my soul with grace.

Thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss

Has made my cup run o’er3
And in a kind and faithful friend
Hos doubled all my store.

Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ;

Nor is the least a cheerful heart,
That testes those gifts with joy.

Through every period of my life
Thy goodness l'll pursue; ⁴
And after doeth, in distant worlds‚

The glorious theme renew.
