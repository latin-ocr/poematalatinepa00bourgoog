WILLIAM AND MARGARET,

ΒΥ nnvm naurs

Wrrnrr nll was wrapt in dark midnight‚
And all were fast asleep,

In glided Margaret’s grimly ghent,
And stood at William’s feet.

Her face was like th'e April mern,
Clad in a wintry cloud;

And clay-aold was her lily hand,
That held the sable shroud.

So shall the fairest fane appear,
When youth and years are flown3
Such is the robe that kings must wear,
When death has reft their crown.

Her bloom was like the springing lower,
That sips the silver dew 3

The rose was budded in her eheek,
And opening to the view.

But love had, like the canker-worm,
Consnm’d her early prime:
The rose grew pale, and left her eheek3

She dy'd before her time.
