106 11111 1111111111.

Undreet at ewning, when she found
Their nolours 10111, their odours past,
She chang'd her look, and on the ground

Her garland and her eye she cast.

That eye dropt sense distinct and clear,
As any muse's tongue could speak 3
When 111111 its lid a pearly tear
¹ Ran triekling down her beauteous cheeh.

Dissembling what 1 knew too well,
My leve, my life, said 1, explain,
, This change 01 1111110111 pr'ythee tell,
That falling tear, what does it mean?

She sigh’d3 she smil'd3 and 10 the flowers

Poinling, the lovely moralist 11111,4
See, friend, in some few lleeting honre,
See yonder, what a change is made!

Ah me 1 the blooming pride 01 May ·
And 11111 01 beauty are but one:

Α1 noan 110111 llourish bright and gay;
xBoth fade at evening‚ pale and gone.

At dawn penr Stella danc'd and sung,
The am'rous youth around her bnw'd;
At night her fatal knell was rung,
l saw, and kiss'd her in her shrnud. '
