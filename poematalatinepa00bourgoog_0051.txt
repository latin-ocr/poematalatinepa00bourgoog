HYMN THE FIRST,

ΒΥ ADDISON·

any all thy mermes, Ο my God,
My rising soul surveyS, “

Transported with the view, l'm lost
In werden lave, and praiae.

O how shall words with equal warmth,
The gratitude declam,

That glows within my ravish'd hreast!
But thou ranst read it there.

Thy providence my life sustain'd‚
And all my wanta redrest3

When in the silent womb 1 lay,
And hung upon the hreast.

Το all my weak complaints and eries
Thy mercy lent an ear,-

Ere yet my feeble thoughts had learnt
Το form themselves in prayer.

Unnumher'd comforts to my soul ‘
Thy tender care hestow'd;

Before my infant heart conceiv'd
From whom those comforts flow’d.
