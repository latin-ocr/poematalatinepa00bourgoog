Praise him, 0 s'un ,- he on the etheree] thmue'
without eclipses has for ever shoue,
And gives thee light, and is like thee b'ut one.
Praise him, Ο moon, in‘ berrow'd lustre bright, ,
In this he fixt, theu changing queen of night.

Ye twinkling stam of light, your praises show,

'Tis he that does your names and numbers know,

Alike inscrutable to 'all below.

· Each stur that does to man its beams dispeuse,
Praise him, as if inspii'd by some intelligenee.

Praise him, ye gentle and refreshing showerS,
Praise him, ye dewsss whose pearly moisture peur's
Odeum and beauties on the vernal flowem'.
Who more should cheose t’ exalt his name than you?
He father is efrain, begetter 'of the dew'.
