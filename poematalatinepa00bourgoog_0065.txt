ΟΝ 'ritu AscuNsmN.

ou THE Ascuuslou.

ΥΕ numerous hosto¹ of angele bright, ’

Your winged multitudes prepare,
Iu all your grandeur to attend
The king of ‘glory through the air.

O make your sweetest harmony,

As he triumphant takes his ssight;
Towering ou high above the sun,

Through reelms immense of spacious light.

In choicest hymns, melodious throng,
Salute the conqueror, your king ;
ln joyful lays and loudest sueino,
Ye blest, your God returniug sing.

And now, in majesty divine,

He sits enrob'd by's Father's side3
But still vouchsafes to intercede

For sinful man, for whom he died.

Then, man, thy deor Redeemer bleso,
With thankful heart, as they above;
With them begin a song of praise,
A song as endless as his love.
