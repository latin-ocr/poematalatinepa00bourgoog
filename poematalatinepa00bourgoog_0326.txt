THE wa-worttt.

anerrrr the hedge, or near the stream,
A worm is known to stra ;

Thot shows by nighta lucii boam,
Which disappears by day.

Disputeo have been, and still premii,
From whence his mys proceed5

Some ive that honour to hio tail,
Ani others to his head.

But thir is sure—the hand os night,
Thnt kindles up the siries,

Gives him a modicum of light
Propertion’d to his sire.

Perhaps indulgent Nature meam,
By such olam bertow'd,

To bid the travethr, as he went,
Be careful where he trod:

Nor erush a worm, whose usehrl light

' hlight serve, however small,

To show a stumbling-stone by night,
And save him [rom afall.

Whate'er she meant, this truth divine
Is legible and plain,

’Tis power aimighty hide him shine‚
Nor bids him shine in vain.

Ye proud and wealthy, iet this theme
Teaeh humbler thoughts to you,
Since such areptile har its gem,

And boastr its splendour too.
