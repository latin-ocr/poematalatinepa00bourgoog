In painted lumea superblydrese'd
Anative the rgeoueennt,
By many a b· low tces’d,
Poll gains at length the Britiah shore,
Part ot the captarn'a precionr store,
A present tc hia tonat.

Belinda’e maida are soon preferr'd,
Το teach him now and then anund,
Aa Poll can master it;
But 'tia her own'important charge,
Το quality him more at large,
And make him quite a wit.

Sweet Poll! hia doting mistress eries,
Sweet Poll! the mimrc bird replies;
And calls alond for sack.
She nert instructa him in the ἤδη
''lln now alittle one, like Miss,
And now a hearty nmaclr.

At first he aima at what he hears;

And, lietening close with hcth hie ears,
Just catches at the anund ;

But scon articulatee aloud,

llluch to the amusement cl the crowd,
And stunc the neighboura round.

A querulous old woman’a voice

His humorcus talent next employa ;
He scolda, and gives the lie.

And now he cinge, and now is sich,

Here Sally, Sanan, come, corne quick,
Poor Poll istite to die!

Belinda and her bird l ’tis rare

To meet with such a well-match’d pair 3
The language and the tone,

Each character in every part

Sustain’d with so much grace and art,
And both in anison.

' When children first begin to spell,
And stammer ont a syllable,
We think them tedicus ereatures3
But difficulties soon abate,
When birds ere to be taught tn prate,
And women are the tenebere.
