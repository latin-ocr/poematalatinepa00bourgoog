“O susan, Susan, lovely dear!
My vows shall ever true remain3
Let me 11111 off that falling tear:
We only part to meet again.
Change as ye list, ye winds3 my heart shall be
The faithful eompass, that still points 10 thee. ’

“ Believe not what the landmen say,

Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind;
They’ll tell thee, 1111011, when away,

ln every port a mistress find: ’
Yes, yes‚ believe them when they tell thee so,
For thou art present, wheresoe'er I go.

“ 1110 fair India’s ooast we sail,

Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright:
'shy breath is Afric’s spiey gale3

Thy ahin is ivory so white:
Thus every-beauteous object, that I view,
Wakes in my soul 1011100110111110110101)Τ 8110.»

“ Though battle call me from thy arms,
Let not my pretty Susan mourn;

J Though cannons 1011, yet safe'from harms

William shall 10 his dear return ;
Love turns aside the¹ balls that round me fly,
Lest precibus tears should drop from Susan's eye.''
