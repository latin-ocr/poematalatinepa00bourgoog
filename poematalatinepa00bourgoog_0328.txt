Tua omem. ⁶

ann inmate, full of mirth,
Chirping on my kitcheu hearth,
wheresoe¹er be thine abedo.
Always harbinger os good,

. Pay me sor thy warm retreat

With a song more sort and sweet3
In return thou shalt receive
Such a strain as Ι can give.

Thus thy praise shall be exqress'd,
Inoffenmve, welcome guest

While the rat is on the seout,

And the meuse with curious snout,
with what vermin else insat
Every dish, and spoil the best5
frisking thus before the fire,

Thou hast all thine heart’s desito.

Though in voice and shape they be
Form d as if akin to thee,

Thou surpassest‚ happier sar,
Happiest grasshoppers that are ;
Theus is but a summer’s song,
Thine endures the winter long,
Unim air'd, and sintin, and clear,
Mel y throughout the year.

Neither night, nor dawn os day,

Puts a penod to thy play:

Sing then-and extend thy span

Far beyond the date os man.
Wretched man, whose years are spent
In repining discontent,

Lives not, aged though he be,

Half a span, compaoed with thee.
