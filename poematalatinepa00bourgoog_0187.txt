THE FANATIC.

Wnnor first to spehh uprises Simon Pure,
Silent he stands, with countenanoe demhre ς

, He ooughs, he spits, with many a hewk and hem,

To clear a way for words, ond utter them: -

His gloves beside him on the pulpit lie, Δ

His two broad hands to heav'n ore lifted high3
With eyelids shut he gruans, for, closely pent,

ΤῙιθ murm’ring spirit struggles for e vent3

At length o voice breaks out heneeth his hat,
Another, ond another after that:

But fair ond soft, with frequent penses mixt, Ἴ
And many a sigh, ond many a grosn betwixt;

Till by degrees he fens, with zealot ire, ’

The dormant coals of puritonic fire 3

Anon, he starts, he bounds, on tiptoe stands,

Roars with his voice, and hommers with-his hends3
The strength of lungs he tries, he pants, he blows,
And down his cheeks the sweat profusely flowsz
To ev'ry soul he threatens instent doom, ,

And a fanatic tempest shokes the room.
So rising Boreas first, with lenient broche,
Faus the light leores, and murmure through the trees ;
