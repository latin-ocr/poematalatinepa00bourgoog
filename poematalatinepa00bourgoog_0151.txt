MELISSA,

In, friend, a wife you meanto wed
Worthy of your board and bed,
That she be vinnons, be your¹ core,
Not too rich, and not too fair:

ι One who nor labours to display

New complexione every day, ’
Nor, studying artificial grace,

Out of boxes oulls a face.
· Nor livelong hours for dressing spareS,

Placing, to displaoe, her heire, ’ ’

’ And straight replaoe; an idle pin

- Ten times shifting out and in.
Nor daily varieS, vainly nice,
Thrice her silks, and colours thrice:
Fond 0'er and 0'er her suits to range,
Changing still, and still to change.
Nor gods to pay, with busy air, ’
Trifling visits here and there,-

' Long rapping at each door aloud,

Nuisonce to a neighbourhood.
If e'er a play she deign to see,
(Very rorely shall it be,) ·
