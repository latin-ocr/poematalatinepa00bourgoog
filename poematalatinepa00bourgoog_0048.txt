eorm or rer rurum ceruorum. 13

Ye rivers, bear his pruise to every laud,
Praise him, ye sees, by whose supreme command
Your greatest ruge is bounded by the saud.
No bouudo or limits are assigu'd you here,
Nor can your utmost forces go too fur.

Praise him, ye wholes, aud ull the silver train, ,
Ther, on the fifth day made, the wotery moin
Within its spurious bosom does contain:
Hie proise, ye fish, by you be olway sung,
Though mute, to bless your Mulier, find a tougue.

’ Praise him, ye fowls, exalt his name, whate’er
Or skims the water, or divides the air,
Who clothes and feeds you with paternol care.
Repeot his praise to every echoing dale,
Ye morning lerk, aud eveniug nightingale.

Praise him, ye beasti, that shady foresto sway,
Who foede the lions roaring for their prey,
Ye temer kinds. that human force ohey,

Proeent your praioe, more grateful to the skies,
Thau thousands of you ulain in sacrifice.

Adoro, ye sons of men, his awfirl name,
Though form’d of earth fill'd with etherea] fleme,
Cast iu the noblest, and the finest frome.
Lot lordly men his sovereign’o preire declaro,
And beauteous woman hless the truly fuir.
