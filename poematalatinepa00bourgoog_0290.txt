Haec ego liberium sed salvo, ut spero, pudore:
Cernitis ingenuus signat ut ora* rubor ! ·

Sin minrrs oblectem, tot flammas inter et ignes;
(Usque adeo 'est nostrae lux inimica cuti)

Si placet, extingui tantum mandate lucernas,-
Protinus irr te'nebris altera Tha'r's ero.

PROLOGUE TO IGNORAMUS,

ΒΥ ¹ANTONIUS· ·

Oncrr in an age let Ignoramus oome

To make a virit near his proper home3
Longis it since at Cambridge he appear'd
And from that time (Ι speak with due regard) x
He has not oft at Westminster been heard.
If any such there‚be among the gown,

He’s some recorder of a factious rown,

Or petty manager against the¹ erown.

An ‘Ignoramus amongst all tho swarm,

Can not be seen here er’ry day in term;

N one 't'o the bar or to the bench pretends,
But he that laws with eloquence defends„
Against the gown nd evil We·intend,

On them our glebe and future tithes depend5
All we propose is to give rome delight,

A scholar-like'diversion'for a' night
