Too well the lovelorn maiden knew

The solemn boding sound,
And thus, in dying words, bespoke
The virgins weeping round:

“ I hear a voice you cannot bear,
Which says, I must not stay ;

Ι see a hand you cannot see,
Which beckons me away.

By a false beart, and broken vows,
In early youth Ι die:

Am 1 to blame, because hio bride
Isthriceasriohosl?

“ Ah, Colin! give not her thy vowo,
Vows ducto me alone3

Nor thou, fond maid, receive his hiso, ’
Nor think him all thy own.

To-morrovv in the church to wod,
Impatient, both prepare ; ,

But know, fond maid; ond know, false mom
Thet Lucy will be there.

“There beer my corso, ye comedes, bear,
The bridegroom blithe to meet,·

He in his wedding trim so gay,
Ι in my windingoheet.”
