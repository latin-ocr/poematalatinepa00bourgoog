Dnspnnmo heside nolent stream,
A shepherd fnrsaken was laid3
And while a false nymph was his theme,
A willnw supported his head.
The winds, that blew over the plain,
To his sighs with a sigh did reply3
And the brnok, in return to his pain,
Ran mournfully murmuring by.

Ales! silly swain th'at I was!
Thus sedly complaining, he cried3
When first I heheld that fair face,
’Twere better hy far I had died:
⁴ Shetah’d,and1blestthedeartongue3
When she smil’d, ’twas a pleasnre too great:
I listen'd, and cry'd, when she sung,
Was nightingnle ever so sweet!

How foolish was 1 tn believe,
She could doat on sn lowly a clown!
Or, that her fond beart would not grieve‚
To for'sake 'the fine foll< of the town}
