Ye clouds, with sulphur ehnrg’d, his praise resound‚

· ¹ Louder than thunder inyour severus bouud3

Lightnings, that quichly die, end dying wound,
' Ere yet your momentary flssh is done,¹
Praise him, whose lustre oen he never gone.

Praise him, Ο earth, whilst thou thysslf shalt lest,
Thy solid orb in liquid ether ploe'd,
Though hung on nothing, is for ever fast:
Praise him whose being is sustein'd hy noue ,· ' ι
Himself is eentre of himself alone.

Ye mounts and hilis, erown'd with a pompous lood
Of groves, where idols plac'd their old ahode,

Resound the praises of a real god, .
Who show'd his goodness, who proelaim'd his will

On Horeb's mountain, and on Sinai's hill.

Praise him, ye greens, hy huitful nature born,

And rising erops thet pleuteous vales adom,

Where zephyrs rustle through the wavy eorn;
Who clothes in greater state each springing green,
Thon thot which drew from farthe southern queen.

Ye wells and streams, your source of moisture know,
Who made, when urg’d of old, his pow'r to show,
Forth from th' obedient rock the waters flow.

N or is the fountain of his praises dry,

But unexhausted stores for ever will supply.
