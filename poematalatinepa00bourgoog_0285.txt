EPILOGUE TO THE ADELPHI, ’

ΒΡΟΚΕΝ BY chunanus,

ENGLISHED.

Poos nurse is sent to bid you all good b'ye, ·
A plain, hut neat and tight old woman 1,

(Exoept what should exceptad be .you.know,)

A wery moer old trot from top to tos.

But come, deor Faustus, try enchantmants here,
And make e’en me a hlooming maid appear ;

‘ Το look with beauty, and to move with ease,

And nicely taught a thousand ways to plesse.
, [She moveo a mand.

Speak, do long lappets wauton wava in air,
Does the strait cawl press. down my auburn hair?
Ano patches rang'd of large and smaller siae? -
Bane to my snowy chest, say, does my bosom nise?
My spreading hoop mise stiff its ampler sphera,
A savenfold arch, an amphitheatro?

Ah! oonjurer Faustus, vain thy wand and skill,
Nor are old women witohes when they-will.

. [She breako'thowand.

Old as 1 was, 1 am ;-<whate'er they say,
Grey wore my looks before, and still ane gray.
No strutting, hoop my dangling clothes bears ont,
Red was, and-red remains,my pettiooat.
