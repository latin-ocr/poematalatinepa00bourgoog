The last humble boon that 1 orave,
Is tn 'shade me with cypress and yew;

And when she looks down in my greve,
Let her own that her shepherd was true

Then to her new love let her go,
And decl< her in golden array3
Be finest at every fine show, “
And frolic it all the long day:
While (lofin, fnrgntten and gone,
Nemore shall be talk’d of, or seen,
Unless when beneath the pale moon
His ghost shnll glide over the green.
