Ann in the Downs the lleet was moor'd,
The streamers 'waving in the wind,
When black-ey'd Susan came on bcard;
“ Oh! where shall I my true love find?
Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
Does my sweet William sail among the crew ?”

. William, who high upon the yard,
Rcck'd with the billows to and ἧος
Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
He sigh'd, and cast his eyes below. x
Τὴθ cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands,
And, quick as lightning, on the deck he stands.

So the sweet lanz, high pois'd in air,
Shuts close his pinions to his breast,

If chance his mate's shrill note he hear,
And drops at once into her nest.

. . The noblest captain in the British fleet,

Might envy William's lips those kisses sweet.
