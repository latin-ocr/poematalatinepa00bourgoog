MELISSA.

She lihes not wit in lewdness shown,

J ests ill-manner'd for a clown;
But hears, with ignorance or rage,
Double meanings of the stage.
Her spotless mind, the lustful tale

Nauseates in the nieeat veil.

She ne'er is found in orowds unclean,
Entred mysteries obscene ς

Nor seeks in maels, and antio dress,
Unconfin'd laseiviousness :

Nor pale, and angry, gaming high,
Rattles the unlucky die.

Till sunrise restless vigils keeps,
Light consuming in her sleeps ;

Inverting nature, turns with play
Day to night, and night to day.

This round of follies let her choose,
Flitting life who likes to lose,

And lets her quickly-ending days
Pass, and perish as they pass.

The time that vulger maids despise,
Caraless, thoughtless‚ how it flio„

Melissa wise, esteems, and knows ’
Well to use it, ere it goes.

If e'er Melissa wed my friend,
With her ent'ring shall attend

Virtues and greces by her side,
Bridemaids fit for such a bride:
