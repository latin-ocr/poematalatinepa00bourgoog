ΟΝ ΤΗΕ FEAST OF PENTECOST.

As Babel's lofty towers proudly rise,

With bold design aspiring to the skies;

The foolish' builder's projeet God eonfounds

With various langueges and different sounds.

But when to build his church th' Almighty came,
Though differing the event, the means the seme,

The gift of lenguagee he did afford
Το them, whom he ordain'd to preech his word:

As knowing that teman he thus hed given
A surer, better way, to reach at heaven.

1N FESTUM SANOTI Mlcneems.

Dum celestem, caelestis turba, triumphum
Hostis, victores dieite, vietus abit.

Vix iterum audebit vestrum sibi poscere caelum,
Ad nova vix iterum ducere bella suos.

Vae terris! nam fraudem illie meditatur et iras,

, Et tentat diros ultor, ut ante, dolos.

Saecula sed vobis secura; ut semper agatis
Perpetuam pacem, perpetuosque choros.
