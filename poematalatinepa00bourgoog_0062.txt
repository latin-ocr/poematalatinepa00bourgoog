ODB.

Then see the sorrowe of my heart, ·
Ere yet it be too late,

And hear my Saviour's dying gronna, ·
Το give those sorrows weight.

For never shall my soul despair
Her pardon to procure;

Who knows thy only Son hae dy'd,
Το make that pardon sure.

AN ODE
TAKEN FROM

THE BEGINNING OF PSALM XIX.

Tum spacious firmament on high,
With all the hlue ethereal sky,

The spangled beamus, a shining frame,
Their great original proclaim.

Τὶιθ unwearied sun, from day to day,
Doee his Creator'e power display3

And publishes to every land

The work of an almighty hand.
