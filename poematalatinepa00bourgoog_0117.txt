LUCY AND COLIN,

Or Leinster, fam'd for maidens fair,
Bright Lucy was the grace3 ζ

Nor e’erdidLiffy's limpid stream
Refleet sofan a face,

Till lucldess love, and pining care,
Impair'd her rosy hue, -

Her eoral lips, and damask cheeks,
And eyes of glossy blue.

Oh, have you seena lily pale,

When *beating ra'ms descend?

So droop'd the slew-eonsuming maid,
Her life now near its end.

By Luey warn'd, of flattering swains
Take heed, ye easy fair:

Of vengeanee due to broken newa,

· Ye perjur’d swains, beware.

Three times, all in the dead of night,
A bell was heard to ring;

And shrieking at her window thrice,
The raven flapp'd his wing.
