Think, Ο my seul, devoutly think,
How with affrighted eyes

Thou saw'st the wide-extended deep
In all its horrore rise!

Confusion dwelt in every face, 2
And feet in every heert,

When waves 011 waves‚ and gulfs in gulsa,
O'ereame the pilot's ert.

Yet then from all my griefS, Ο hurd,
Thy mercy set me free ;

While in the confidente of prayer
My soul took hold on thee.

For though in dreedful whirls we hung,

High on the broken wave,·
I knew thou wert not slew to hear,
Nor impetent to save.

The storm was laid, the winde retir'd‚
Obedient to thy will3

The see, that roar’d at thy command,
At thy command was still.

In midet of dengere, fears, and deaths,

. Hy goodness I'll adore ;

And praise thee for thy mercies pest,
And humbly hope for more.
