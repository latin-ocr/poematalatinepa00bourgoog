I'll daily at my window fay,
Assur'd‚ that daily those supplies
With grateful song thou wilt repay.

Soon as the new-returning spring

Shall call thee forth towoods and graves,
Frealy revisit then the soene, ·

Which notes as sweet as thine approvesa
But if another winter's blast.

Should bring ma back my guest again,
Again with music come prapar'd·

Thy friendly host to entertain.⁴

In this its hestaffeet appeam,
That friendship in thehstriotest hands
laboth engages and endears.
In musia's ravishing delights

You feather’d raca with men agree3
of all the animated world
The only hannonists are we.
