Fhes round, or sits upon her breast,
Α little, flutt'ring‚ idle guest.

E’er since that day, the beauteous maid
Governs the world in Cupid's stead,
Direato his arrows, as she willa 3
Gives grief or pleasure 3 spares or kills.

CHLOE HUNTING,

Barnun her neck her comely tresses tied,

Her iv’ry quiver graceful by her eide,

A hunting Chloe went: she lost her way,

And through the woodo uncertain ahanc'd to stray.
Apollo passing hy heheld the maid 3

And, Sister dear, bright Cynthia, turn, he said;
The hunted hind lies close in yonder brake.
Loud Cupid laugh'd, to see the god’a mistake:
And laughing nied, Learn better, great divine,
To know thy kindred‚ and to honour mine.
Rightly advis'd, far hence thy sister seek,

Or on Meander's bankS, or Latmus' peak.

But in thie nymph, my friend, my aiater know ;
She drawa my arrows, and she bends my how.
