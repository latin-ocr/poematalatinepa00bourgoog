100 nova elstano.-

Who happen'd, being blind, to stray‚
And 011 thy bosom lost his way:

Who stray'd, alas! hut 'knew too well,
He never there must hope to dwell.

Set an unhappy pris'ner free,
Who ne'er intended harm to thee.’'

“ To me pertains n0t‚'' she rephes,
“ Το know or aare where Cupid flies ;
What are his haunts, or which his way3
’ Where he would dweH, or whither stray: ⁴
Yet will I never set thee free;
For harm was meant, and harm to me.”

“ Vain fears that vex thy· virgin heart!
I'll'give thee up my how and dart:
Untangle but this aruel chain,

And freely let me fly again.'’

“ Agreed! secure my virgin heart;
Instant give up thy bow and dart:
The chain l'll in return untie ;

And freely thou again shalt fly.”
Thus she the captive did deliver;
The captive thus gave up his quiver.

, The god, disarm’d‚ e'er since that day,
Posses his life in harmless play3
