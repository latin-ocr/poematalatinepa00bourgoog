Though l oare not for richoo, may 1 not be so poor,
That the rich without shame cannot enter my door3
May they court my oonversel', moy they take much
delight
My old stories to hear in a winter's long night.
May Ι govern, etc.

My small stook of wit may Ι not misapply,
To {latter ill men, be they never so high;
N or mispend the few momento Ι steal from the grove,
ln fawning and oringing like a dog or o slave.
May I govern, etc.

Moy none whom Ι love, to so gleat richooc riso,
As to slight their eoquaintonce, and their old friends
So low or so high moy none of them be, [deopi ;
As to move either pity or envy in me.

May 1 govern, etc.

A friendship Ι wish for, but alas! 'tis in vain,
J ove’s storehouse is empty, and oan’t it supply,
So firm, that no change of timeo, envy, or gain,
Or flattery, or woman, should have power to untie. ,

May Ι govern, etc.
