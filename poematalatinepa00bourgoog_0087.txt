Ι That faoe, alos! no more ir fair ;
That lip no longer red3
Dark ore mine eyes, now clos'd in death,
And every charm is fled.

The hungry worm my sister is ,-
This windingsheetl wear ;

And cold and weary lasis our night,
Till that lastmorn appear.

But hark! the eook hos warn’d me hence:
A long and last odieu!

Come see, false man! how low she lies,
That died for love of you.

Now birds did sing, and morning ornile,
And show her glittering head:

Pale william shook in every limb,
Then raving left his bed.

He hied him to the fatal place
Where Margaret's body loy, ¹
And stretch’d him on the green grass turf,
'rhat wrapt her brenthless clay.

And thrice he eall'd on Margaret’s nome,
And thrice he wept full sore ς

Then.laid his cheeh to the oold earth,
And word spake never more. ’
